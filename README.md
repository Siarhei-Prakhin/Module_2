1. I don't understand the third paragraph of main task - if I have to create one branch "task2" in the repo, or two branches - "main" and "task2". So I created two branches (it seems to me that this is not critical). Vagrantfile is in the "task2" branch.
2. During the creation of machines I have to choose the gateway interface of my workstation, because sometimes I have internet access through WiFi, sometimes throuh 3g-modem.
